> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-Level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy the High and Mid-Level Objectives.

## High-Level Objective

- [High level goal goes here - what do you want to build?]

## Mid-Level Objective

- [List of mid-level objectives - what are the steps to achieve the high-level objective?]
- [Each objective should be concrete and measurable]
- [But not too detailed - save details for implementation notes]

## Implementation Notes

- [Important technical details - what are the important technical details?]
- [Dependencies and requirements - what are the dependencies and requirements?]
- [Coding standards to follow - what are the coding standards to follow?]
- [Other technical guidance - what are other technical guidance?]

## Context

### Beginning context
<!--
Optional: List files/folders that already exist in the codebase BEFORE this feature.
Helpful for preventing overwrites or duplication.

✅ Use when editing existing modules
❌ Skip for small new features or prototypes
-->

- [List of files that exist at start - what files exist at start?]

### Ending context
<!--
Optional: List expected files/folders AFTER the feature is implemented.
This helps Gemini CLI generate the correct file structure and placement.

✅ Use when you want full control over output structure
❌ Skip if you're okay with the CLI inferring structure
-->

- [List of files that will exist at end - what files will exist at end?]

## Low-Level Tasks

> Ordered from start to finish

1. [First task - what is the first task?]

```
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What are details you want to add to drive the code changes?
```

2. [Second task - what is the second task?]

```
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What are details you want to add to drive the code changes?
```

3. [Third task - what is the third task?]

```
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What are details you want to add to drive the code changes?
```

## EXAMPLES

Provide links or file paths to patterns the agent should emulate.

- [Insert more relevant examples as needed]

---

## DOCUMENTATION

Include links to official docs, internal documentation, or anything else the AI should use to understand the problem.

- https://developers.google.com/ai/gemini/cli#commands — Gemini CLI reference
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html — argparse docs
- [Insert more references as needed]

---

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Mention anything that could trip up the implementation.

- `.env` must not be committed — include in `.gitignore`
- All CLI output must be JSON-formatted
- Avoid logging secrets
- Rate limit API calls if applicable
- [Add any other known pitfalls or constraints]
